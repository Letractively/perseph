	[Entity Creation]

		In each case Key is replace with the actual key(s) required for the object. If an entity
		should happen to have multipl non-composite keys multiple functions will be exposed.
		
		withKey
			Produces an entity with the given key as a key. It may load existing data for the
			entity, or it may check if it exists.  It will generally not fail.
			
			Functions: checkNew, load
			
		findWithKey
			The returned entity will have be confirmed to have existed, otherwise an exception
			is thrown if it cannot be found/loaded.
			
			Functions: save, delete
		
		createWithKey
			Indicates you wish to "add" this new entity. Create may check at this time if it is
			a new entity, or it may defer that to the add function.
			
			Functions: add
		
		findOrCreateWithKey
			Indicates that you wish to create a new entity or load an existing one if possible.
			After calling this function the current status will be known (is it new or loaded),
			but that may change by the time an update function is made.
			
			Functions: save, delete
		
		search
			Search takes either an array of DBS_Query options, or the same options as a
			variable argument list.  The result of this array will be an Iterator which can be
			iterated a "single" time.
			
			That object will also expose a function called "endSearch" which can be used
			to end the searching prematurely if so desired -- strictly a resource consideration.
			
		searchDelete
			Takes the same arguments as search, but deletes the entities rather than
			returning the found results.
